didnt get url yet b/c best price is to buy if from host
think it should be on blue host,  -> hosting recommended by wordpress
there is a plan specifically for woocommerce, it is much more expensive than the kind that isn't specifically designes for woo commerce
choice plus is 125 / year vs woocommerce standard is 239 per year, 114 dollar difference because you're just starting, the choice plus wouldnt be an issue, but the woocommerce standard would be better
3 year woocommerce standard is 514 for three years, so that is an option -> she wants to do the three years
normally i would charge 900 for a site like this, 
because there is no rush I will charge 700 for the site and 15 a month for maintenance

new plan is to sell starting this spring, want to place orders by spring
pages that describe environments, not check boxes
have add to cart buttons on pages that describe the different types of environments
january is website up date, no preorder cutoff, if inventory is out, default to having them request a specific plant
have it email janet when the inventory is almost out

see if woocommerce is good with bank accounts or if paypal charges for businesses

send invoice for dev work -> done
start site when paid!
